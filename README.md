### Brief Bio
I am currently an associate professor in School of Computer and Information Engineering at [Beijing Technology and Business University] (http://www.btbu.edu.cn), China. Before joining BTBU, I received her MSc and PhD from [Beihang University] (http://www.buaa.edu.cn), China in 2014 and 2018, advised by Prof. Junhua Sun. During 2016-2018, I was a visiting PhD student at The University of Edinburgh under the supervision of Prof. [Robert B. Fisher] (http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/), where I focused on 3D lip motion and behaviometrics. 

My research interests lie at computer vision, pattern recognition, and 3D vision measurement.

### Ongoing Funding

1. **National Natural Science Funding of China**, "3D lip motion representation under unconstrainted poses for behaviometrics", 2019-2021 (ongoing)
2. **National Key Research and Development Science Funding of China**, "Towards 3D visual quality inspection for car engine manufacture: localizing and recognizing multiple micro-faults from cluttered backgrouds in 3D point clouds",2019-2021 (ongoing)
3. **Basic Research Funding of BTBU**, "Extracting 3D dynamic face features for identity recognition", 2018-2020 (ongoing)
