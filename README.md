I am currently an associate professor in School of Computer and Information Engineering at Beijing Technology and Business University, China. Before joining BTBU, I received her MSc and PhD from Beihang University, China in 2014 and 2018, advised by Prof. Junhua Sun. During 2016-2018, I was a visiting PhD student at The University of Edinburgh under the supervision of Prof. Robert B. Fisher, where I focused on 3D lip motion and behaviometrics. 

My research interests lie at computer vision, pattern recognition, and 3D vision measurement.

### Ongoing Funding

1. _National Natural Science Funding of China_, "3D lip motion representation under unconstrainted poses for behaviometrics", 2019-2021 (ongoing)
2. _National Key Research and Development Science Funding of China_, "Towards 3D visual quality inspection for car engine manufacture: localizing and recognizing multiple micro-faults from cluttered backgrouds in 3D point clouds",2019-2021 (ongoing)
3. _Basic Research Funding of BTBU_, "Extracting 3D dynamic face features for identity recognition", 2018-2020 (ongoing)
